The initial commit for the app was created by givinhg Google Jules this prompt:<br>
Create a trivial Web app that runs entirely within the browser. Use only pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript builtins, with no dependencies on other Javascript frameworks or libraries. Avoid using inline Javascript, and instead put as much of the Javascript in a separate .js file instead. The app presents a single button labeled "Press Me", and beneath the button the text "Times pressed: " followed by the number of times the button has been pressed since the app started running. Name the app's launcher file "button-press-counter.html".
